<h1>The Witness</h1>
The Witness is a short puzzle game inspired by the line-drawing mechanic found in the game with the same title. I developed it in C# using Visual Studio 2022, wanting to challenge myself with a mouse-based system where the player can "free-roam" within the grid boundries.

The game features 12 original, handmade levels with increasing complexity and is played on a class-based grid-layout that leans heavily on object-orientated programming. The focus on modular level design and progression systems helped refine my approach to structuring logic-heavy games, and it remains one of my most rewarding solo builds due to its combination of technical depth and creative problem-solving.
